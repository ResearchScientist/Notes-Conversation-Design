# Confirmations

Confirm the user's inputs in a natural implicit manner.

| bot | user | experience |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Would you like tea or coffee? | I want coffee. |  |
| Great, you said coffee. Would you like a small or a large size? |  | bad |
| Would you like a small or large coffee. |  | good |

For voice interaction an earcon may be better than a lengthy message.

| user | bot |
| --- | --- |
| Lock the door. | "ding" |

But on certain occasions, a message may be preferred by a user.  Important tasks such as those involving security and safety would be better communicated via an explicit message to give the user that additional piece of mind.

You can go even further and offer the user the option to state their preferences for confirmations.
