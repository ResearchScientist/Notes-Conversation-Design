# Machine Learning

For a bot to determine intent it requires many sample utterances to compare against the user's utterance.

## Over Training

Over Training can lead to bias.

To avoid overtraining use a data set that
- is large
- is balanced
- contains varied constructions
- is obtained from different demographics

# Intents

- questions
- calls for action
- help
- feedback
- insult
- small talk
- repeat
- handover
- skip
- stop
- correction
